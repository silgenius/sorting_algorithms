## Introduction

Sorting algorithms are fundamental tools in computer science, used to arrange elements in a specific order. This repository serves as a reference for various sorting algorithms implemented in different programming languages, providing insights into their performance characteristics and use cases.

## List of Sorting Algorithms

1. [Bubble Sort](./bubble_sort)
   - Description: Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

2. [Insertion Sort](./insertion_sort)
   - Description: Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.

3. [Selection Sort](./selection_sort)
   - Description: Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist and an unsorted sublist.

4. [Merge Sort](./merge_sort)
   - Description: Merge sort is an efficient, stable, and comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort.

5. [Quick Sort](./quick_sort)
   - Description: Quick sort is an efficient, in-place, and comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays.

6. Shell Sort
   - Description: Shell sort is a generalization of insertion sort that allows the exchange of items that are far apart.

7. Cocktail Shaker Sort
   - Description: Cocktail shaker sort is a variation of bubble sort that sorts the array in both directions, moving the largest elements to the end and the smallest elements to the beginning.

8. Counting Sort
   - Description: Counting sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that sorts elements based on their keys by counting the number of occurrences of each distinct element.

9. Heap Sort
   - Description: Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds a binary heap from the input array and then repeatedly extracts the maximum element from the heap and rebuilds the heap until the array is sorted.

10. Radix Sort
    - Description: Radix sort is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping the keys by individual digits.

11. Bitonic Sort
    - Description: Bitonic sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that can sort in parallel, particularly suitable for implementation on parallel processors.

12. Quick Sort - Hoare Partition Scheme
    - Description: Quick sort is a widely used sorting algorithm that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy. The Hoare partition scheme is an efficient partitioning method used in Quick sort.
